# Visual demographics

This repository contains a jupyter notebook 'main.ipynb' for explorative data analysis of demographic data. The datasets are downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and can be found in the 'data' subdirectory. Some utility functions can be found in 'functions.py'. 

The notebook is divided to three sections. First, we create a single pandas dataframe to store all the data in a unified format. Then, we visually explore the data using plotting libraries as well as dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. Lastly, after some feature engineering, we compare how different regression algorithms are able to learn feature estimation.
